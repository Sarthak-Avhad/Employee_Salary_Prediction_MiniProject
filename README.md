# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction – Machine Learning Regression Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **employee salaries** using Machine Learning regression techniques.  
The goal is to analyze employee-related features and build a model that can accurately estimate salary based on experience, education, job role, and other relevant attributes.

## 🔹 Project Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Handle missing values and data inconsistencies  
3. Perform feature encoding (categorical variables)  
4. Feature scaling (if required)  
5. Split dataset into training and testing sets  
6. Train regression model (e.g., Linear Regression or other models)  
7. Evaluate model using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - R² Score  
8. Predict salary for new input data
